# Boss handoff (2026-10-05)

Read `docs/agents/team.md` first: roles, flow, owner stops and token rules. Then
`docs/agents/phase9.md`: the plan and the briefs to send word for word, with the owner's
decisions already recorded.

## State (2026-10-06)
- **Released:** v0.7.0 (2026-10-05).
- **Merged since:**
  - #38: one-line mode tabs;
  - #39: place search shows the town;
  - #40: C1;
  - #41: C3;
  - #42: one-tap in-app update (works from 0.8.0 on);
  - #43: UI-test idle fix.
- **Running:** C4 (#44, the Quick Settings tile). The owner has approved merging it once it is green.
- **Next:**
  1. When #44 merges: start C5 and C6 in parallel. Each gets a Sonnet tester+designer review, then the owner merges.
  2. Phase 9 close-out: `docs/releases/v0.8.0.md` from `docs/releases/next/*`, the Android 8 Back ROADMAP item, then release 0.8.0.

## Owner standing orders
- **Usage limits, the boss handles them alone (owner, 2026-10-06):** the owner should never have
  to wake the boss after a reset.
  - **Before starting any agent or review,** read `rate_limit_info` (`get_session` with no id).
  - **If the 5-hour limit reads `allowed_warning` or `rejected`:** don't start. Schedule one
    `send_later` for `resetsAt` + 5 min that starts the task then.
  - **If an agent stalls on "session limit · resets …":** schedule its resume the same way,
    unprompted.
  - **While the 7-day limit reads `allowed_warning`:** at most one Opus implementer plus one
    Sonnet review at a time.
  - **Rough costs:** an implementer package is $4–23; a Sonnet review is about $1; a fix round
    is $2–5.
- When an agent asks a question, the boss answers it if the answer is clear from the briefs,
  the skills and the owner's recorded decisions; otherwise it passes the question to the owner
  (2026-10-05).

## Gotchas learned
- **Agents go idle on red CI.** PR events don't reach agent sessions. The briefs now tell agents
  to self-check once per push; if one still sits idle on a red PR, wake it with the failing job
  and log line.
- **Goldens go stale after every code push.** Emulator jobs first, goldens last, from the same
  head's run (`parallel-work`).
- **Auto mode blocks traffic redirection** (for example a Gradle mirror in `~/.gradle/init.d/`)
  and the agent stalls on a permission prompt. Interrupt it, then steer it with a message.
- **Agents copy the boss's permission mode.** The boss must run in **Auto** on the server
  (check `permission_mode` with `get_session`), or agents stall in plan/default mode.
- **The shared 5-hour usage limit:** resume stalled agents after the reset. Keep it to 2 agents.
- **Agents report once (done or blocked).** No check-ins, no CI subscriptions; one fallback
  check-in hours apart.
- **Nobody pushes to another agent's branch.** Archive each session once its PR merges.
